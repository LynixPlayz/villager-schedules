# Villager Schedules 
A fabric mod that adds a Hud which shows what all the villagers are doing.
Schedules taken from https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Villager#Schedules.

This mod was created because i was too lazy to look at a clock and search up the minecraft wiki.
So I decided to spend a couple hours of my time creating a mod that probably didn't even save me time.

I know, I'm extremely intelligent.

you should download it from here, that would be very cool of you and i would be very happy. thanks bye
