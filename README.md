# villager-schedules
A fabric mod that adds a Hud which shows what all the villagers are doing.
Schedules taken from https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Villager#Schedules.

This mod was created because i was too lazy to look at a clock and search up the minecraft wiki.
So I decided to spend a couple hours of my time creating a mod that probably didn't even save me time.
I know, I'm extremely intelligent.
